    \n## This is a sub-heading...
    \n### And here's some other cool stuff:
    
    \nHeres some code, \`<div></div>\`, between 2 backticks.
    \n
    \`\`\`
    // this is multi-line code:
    
    function anotherExample(firstLine, lastLine) {
      if (firstLine == '\`\`\`' && lastLine == '\`\`\`') {
        return multiLineCode;
      }
    }
    \`\`\`
    
    \nYou can also make text **bold**... whoa!  
Or _italic_.  
Or... wait for it... **_both!_**  
And feel free to go crazy ~~crossing stuff out~~.
    
    \nThere's also [links](https://www.freecodecamp.com), and
    \n> Block Quotes!
    
    \nAnd if you want to get really crazy, even tables:
    
    \nWild Header | Crazy Header | Another Header?
------------ | ------------- | -------------
Your content can | be here, and it | can be here....
And here. | Okay. | I think we get it.
